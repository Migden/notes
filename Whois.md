### WHOIS Enumeration
--------------------------------
Whois is a TCP service, tool, and type of database that can provide information about a domain name, such as the [[Name Server]] and *registrar*. This information is normally public

`whois <DNSNAME> -h <WHOIS SERVER IP>`


If we have an IP address, we can conduct a reverse lookup and gather more information

`whois <Target IP> -h <WHOIS SERVER IP>`, This will give us information about who is hosting the IP address
