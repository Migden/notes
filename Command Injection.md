### OS Command Injection
--------------------------------
Web application often need to interact with the underlying operating system, such as when a file is created, or to conduct website functionality.

Typically a website should have a list of commands for the interaction with the system that are predetermined and can't change. However in a lot of cases this can't be done, so user input is taken in and "sanitized"
