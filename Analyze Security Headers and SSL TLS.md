### Security Headers
--------------------------------
*Security Headers* refers to special directives sent by a web server to a browser instructing it to implement specific security measures when rendering a webpage.

One site called https://securityheaders.com/, will analyze HTTP response headers and provide an analysis on the websites security posture. Missing important headers is not a security vulnerability, but they should be always used as a precaution and could indicate that the web developers are not familiar with [[Server Hardening]]

### SSL and TLS
----------------
Another tool called https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ can analyze a servers SSL/TLS configuration and compare to best practices. It will also identify if the SSL/TLS is vulnerable to any exploits
