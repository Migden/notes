NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a network service that enables applications of different computer to communicate with each other across a LAN. It delivers its service in the 5th layer of the OSI model.

NetBIOS is technically an API and allows for multiple different services to communicate information such as hostnames e.t.c. It is crucial in many protocols to establish information before a connection is made
