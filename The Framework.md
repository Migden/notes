The Volatility Framework consists of several subsystems that work together to provide a robust set of features

### VTypes
--------------------------------
`VTypes` is volatility's structure definition and parsing language. Since most applications and subsystems run on C, Volatility a python program needs a way to represent C data structures in python.

Consider the following C data structure:

```C
struct process { int pid; int parent_pid; char name[10]; char * command_line; void * ptv; };
```

This structure has two integer values, a character array, a string pointer and a NULL pointer. This structure can be simply represented in python utilising dictionaries.

```python
['process' : [ 26, { 'pid' : [ 0, ['int']], 'parent_pid' : [ 4, ['int']], 'name' : [ 8, ['array', 10, ['char']]], 'command_line' : [ 18, ['pointer', ['char']]], 'ptv' : [ 22, ['pointer', ['void']]], }]
```

This a basically just a dictionary with a dictionary inside with all the attributes of the C data structure, except the key reference an array with the index to the value in the stack and type of the structure object (int, str).

### Objects and Classes
---------
A `Volatility Object` is an instance of a structure that exists at a specific address within an address space. For example you create an object by calling `_EPROCESS`. Once the object is created you can access any of the underlying objects methods and members.

An `Object Class` enables you to extend the functionality of an object, you could attach methods or properties to an object that then become accessible to all instances of the object

### Profiles
--------
A `profile` is a collection of the `Vtypes`, `Overlays`, and `Object Classes` for a specific operating system version and hardware architecture.

A profile usually contains the following information:
- Metadata- OS name, Kernel version, build numbers
- System call information
- Constant values - Global that can be found a various addresses
- Native types - Low level types for native languages, sizes of integers, str, etc.
- System map - addresses of critical global variables and functions
